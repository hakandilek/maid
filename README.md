# MAID AI Development toolset

## Project Summary

MAID AI Development toolset is a comprehensive set of command-line tools and utilities designed to help software engineers, developers, and AI enthusiasts streamline their workflow, automate repetitive tasks, and improve productivity. MAID leverages advanced AI and language models to provide features such as code review, issue detection, missing tests identification, and code summarization.

The toolset is heavily influenced by the [blog entry and setup by Harper Reed](https://harper.blog/2025/02/16/my-llm-codegen-workflow-atm/). The project aims to provide a more user-friendly and accessible version of the tools and utilities for this workflow.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) is for the initial setup of MAID.
- and [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) is internally used for running the commands.
